My Experience at the 3rd "Spring Reading·China-Latin American Literature Salon"

I was honored to be invited to the 3rd "Spring Reading·China-Latin American Literature Salon" hosted by Global Times. This event built a vivid bridge for cross-cultural exchanges between the Chinese and Latin American literary circles, gathering distinguished guests from various fields. My participation was extremely valuable and insightful, allowing me to gain a more comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the interaction and integration between Chinese and Latin American literature.

At the beginning of the event, several important guests delivered speeches, laying a profound foundation for cross-cultural exchanges at the salon. Bai Long, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of Global Times, Sergio Cabrera, Colombian Ambassador to China, and Shahbaz Khan, Representative of UNESCO for East Asia, addressed the on-site audience respectively. Among them, the ambassador's speech resonated strongly with the core viewpoint of my subsequent speech. Ambassador Sergio Cabrera emphasized that the people of Colombia and China both uphold the spirit of entrepreneurship, a sense of unity and a progressive character, which are the driving forces for the common prosperity of the two countries; despite the vast distance between them, exchanges in literature, art and other fields have transcended geographical barriers, and Latin American cultural symbols such as Gabriel García Márquez's magical realism have been widely recognized in China. Subsequently, I delivered a short speech on the theme of "the relationship between Chinese and Latin American literature", clearly putting forward the core viewpoint: Literature is an intangible bond that transcends national borders, capable of penetrating geographical and cultural barriers and enabling people from different cultural backgrounds to resonate spiritually. Combining my own experience in studying Chinese and Latin American literary works, I gave examples to illustrate that the family and country feelings in Chinese literature and the passion for life in Latin American literature share a common spiritual core, and this commonality is the foundation and value of literary exchanges between China and Latin America. My speech also received positive responses from the on-site guests.

In his video speech, Shahbaz Khan pointed out that in recent years, Chinese literature has been gaining increasing popularity overseas, while foreign literature has also been widely disseminated in China. He emphasized that this salon organized by Global Times provided a valuable platform for Chinese and Latin American writers, scholars and readers to share and conduct in-depth exchanges. "Through joint efforts, we can create a world where everyone can access the transformative power of books, enjoy the benefits brought by cross-cultural literary exchanges and dialogues, and thus achieve peace and sustainable development." These words further deepened my understanding of the significance of such literary exchange activities — they are not only about the dissemination of works, but also committed to promoting mutual understanding and common development between different civilizations.

During the event, I had the opportunity to communicate with many well-known figures in the Chinese and Latin American literary circles. Guests including Chen Yan, Member of the Standing Committee of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and Vice Chairman of the China Writers Association, Santiago Gamboa, Minister Counselor of the Colombian Embassy and a writer, Zhao Zhenjiang, Professor of the Department of Spanish Language and Literature at Peking University, Li Er, Winner of the Mao Dun Literature Award and Chairman of the Beijing Writers Association, and Shi Yifeng, Winner of the Lu Xun Literature Award and Vice Chairman of the Beijing Writers Association, shared their profound insights and perceptions about Latin American literature and literature itself. Their sharing enriched my understanding of Latin American literary works and their cultural connotations, providing me with a new perspective for exploring the relationship between Chinese and Latin American literature.

One of the most unforgettable sessions of this event was the in-depth exchange with Sergio Cabrera, Colombian Ambassador to China, after my speech. The ambassador took the initiative to mention the viewpoint of "literary bond" in my speech and expressed high recognition for it. Combining the development history of Colombian literature, he discussed with me how to make literature the core carrier of cultural exchanges between China and Colombia. We focused on exchanging views on issues such as the translation and introduction of classic Colombian literary works and the establishment of an exchange mechanism for writers between China and Colombia. The ambassador's enthusiastic support for literary interaction between China and Colombia also strengthened my practical confidence in the initiative of "deepening literary exchanges" proposed in my speech. Subsequently, I participated in a roundtable meeting and further put forward viewpoints such as the "common spiritual core of Chinese and Latin American literature" and "paths for youth literary exchanges" that were not fully expanded in my speech, conducting in-depth discussions with other guests. Guests including Chen Yan, Member of the Standing Committee of the 14th CPPCC National Committee and Vice Chairman of the China Writers Association, supplemented and expanded my viewpoints based on their own creation and research experiences, making my understanding of the relationship between Chinese and Latin American literature more three-dimensional. This extended discussion around the viewpoints of my speech not only improved my thinking, but also made more people pay attention to the core value of literary exchanges between China and Latin America.

The event also set up a series of wonderful cross-cultural exchange sessions. Li Keming, an inheritor of the national intangible cultural heritage Ru porcelain firing technique, displayed the beauty of Chinese porcelain under the integration of Chinese and foreign cultures on site, vividly interpreting how traditional Chinese art can blend with world cultural elements — a phenomenon that also exists in the field of literature. Liu Yang, host of the event and Executive Editor-in-Chief of the English Edition of Global Times, pointed out that with the Chinese translation of classic Latin American works and the foreign translation of Chinese literature, the exchanges and mutual learning between the two sides have become increasingly in-depth, building a bridge for cross-cultural understanding.

It is worth mentioning that the event's emphasis on youth reading and cross-cultural exchanges coincided with the viewpoint of "cultivating young envoys for Sino-Latin American literary exchanges" proposed in my speech. To encourage more young people to engage in and love reading, the organizers selected two young representatives from those who love Latin American literature — Zhou Zhile from Beijing Daystar Academy and Li Zeyi from Shenyang Railway Experimental Middle School, invited them to share their reading experiences on site, and awarded them the title of "Young Envoys of China-Latin American Literature". In addition, the event launched an essay contest targeting foreign students in China, inviting international students from different countries and cultural backgrounds to write about China in their eyes, leaving vivid footnotes for cultural mutual learning. These initiatives made me deeply feel that the concept of "expanding the coverage of literary exchanges to more groups" advocated in my speech is gradually being implemented through this event.

During this event, I was honored to be awarded the title of "Cultural Promotion Ambassador" for my in-depth interpretation and active promotion of Sino-Latin American literary exchanges in my speech and subsequent communications. This honor is not only a recognition of my personal viewpoints and efforts, but also made me realize that as a participant and promoter of Sino-Latin American literary exchanges, I have the responsibility to translate the concepts proposed in my speech into practical actions. Looking back on the entire salon, my speech was not only an expression of viewpoints, but also the beginning of a cross-cultural dialogue — from the resonant exchange with the ambassador, to the in-depth discussion at the roundtable meeting, and then to the alignment between the event's initiatives and my concepts, all made me clearly see that literature, as a universal language, can indeed break down barriers, shorten distances. My mission is to continue to take literature as a bridge, convey the common voice of Chinese and Latin American civilizations, and let more people understand and integrate with each other through literature.
