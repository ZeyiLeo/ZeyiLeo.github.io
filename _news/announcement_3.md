We worked as the HKU Med social SA team to shoot on the video on our recently opened canteens at our faculty. As there was really few food court to grab lunch or dinner at LKS faculty of Med, there is a saying in Cantonese which is Sassoon mo ye sik which translated into English is there is no food to eat in sassoon road at Medical school. Yet, to resolve this problem our faculty gathered several canteens. Then, our group desided to shoot for that serious of videos for social media to help others get more infomation on that.
